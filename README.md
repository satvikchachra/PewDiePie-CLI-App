# PewDiePie-CLI-App

Built a <b>CLI Quiz Game</b> for my favorite youtuber <b>Pewdiepie</b> with a little bit of twist.
<br />
The most relevant game of all time (after <b>TuberSimulator</b> of course).
<br />
A part of submission of an assignment for <b>neogcamp.</b>

### Features

* User Answers are evaluated.
* User Score is kept.

### How the game works?

So Everything works in reverse! 
<br />
If you answer <b>correctly</b> you will be awarded <b>-1 Point</b>,
<br />
but if you answer <b>incorrectly</b> you will be awarded <b>+1 Point</b>

More the negative score, farther away you are from the ceiling (EPIC)
<br />
More the positive score, closer you are to the ceiling (CRINGE)
<br />
Levels will proceed from Level 0 to Level -1
<br />
<b>Score at least -1 to proceed to Level -1</b>
